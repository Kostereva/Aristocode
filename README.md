# 🏛 Coding in Old Money Style: Elegance in Every Line  

> _"True elegance is simplicity and precision."_  
> — Giacomo Puccini  

### 📜 Project: **Aristocode**  
When you hear "old money," you picture aristocratic estates, classical music, and impeccable style. But what if the elite of the past were programmers? Their code would be **refined, minimalist, and efficient**—just like their lifestyle.  

Here’s how code in the **old money** style might look:  

```python
class Aristocrat:

📌 Why Does This Matter?
🔹 Minimalism in code, like in grand estate architecture.
🔹 Every line has purpose, just like a family crest.
🔹 Investing in knowledge and technology is the foundation of real wealth.

    def __init__(self, name, wealth, wisdom):
        self.name = name
        self.wealth = wealth
        self.wisdom = wisdom

    def invest(self, asset, amount):
        return f"{self.name} invests ${amount:,} in {asset} – a strategic decision."

    def read(self, book):
        return f"{self.name} reads '{book}' – knowledge is worth more than gold."

# Example usage:
gentleman = Aristocrat("Lord Wellington", 10_000_000, "Philosophy")
print(gentleman.invest("startups", 500_000))
print(gentleman.read("The Art of War"))
# Aristocode
